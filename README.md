Hello
THis is My summative work.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                             Submission Reminder App
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main branch contains detailed files on how to run the reminder app for various individuals/students who havenâ€™t turned in their assignments. The main branch consist of 

create_environment.sh :- This is the shell script file, I used to create the app environment and run the app. It contains the commands I used  to create it.

copilot_shell_scripting.sh :- This is a file that contains details I used to modify the assignment.
                                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
                                              How to Run the App 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the app, you must first run the create_environment.sh (./create_environment.sh) file on a terminal. When run, you will be prompted to input your first name.

After you are done running the file, a new directory would be created.

cd (change directory) to the new directory and run the startup.sh file (./startup.sh) 
            


To check the deadline of particular assignments, the user will have to run the copilot_shell_script (./copilot_shell_script).

When run, the user will be prompted to input the assignment name. After the assignment name has been inputted, the user will be showed the list of individials with unsubmitted assignments for the particular assignment.
             
Please note: The (create_environment.sh) script must be run first before the (copilot_shell_script.sh) script.



                                            THANK YOU & HAVE A NICE DAY
